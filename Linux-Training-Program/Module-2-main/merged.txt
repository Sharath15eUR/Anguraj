#1) Use the appropriate command to list all files larger than 1 MB in the current directory and save the output to a file.

#To list all files in the current directory 
ls -l

#To filter the size in column 5 with size more than 1MB = 1000000 bytes 
ls -l | awk '$5+0>1000000 {print $9}'
#2) Replace all occurrences of "localhost" with "127.0.0.1" in a configuration file named config.txt, and save the updated file as updated_config.txt.

#to see the content of the file
cat config.txt

#to replace all occurrences of "localhost" with "127.0.0.1"
sed 's/localhost/127.0.0.1/g' config.txt

#3) Use the appropriate command to search for lines containing the word "ERROR" in a log file but exclude lines containing "DEBUG". Save the results to a file named filtered_log.txt.

#to see the content of log file 
cat sample_log.log

#to filter the value with field seperator as ':' and ERROR in field 1
awk -F: '$1~/ERROR/' sample_log.log >filtered_log.txt

#to view the content of output file 
cat filtered_log.txt
#4) Write a code to identify the process with the highest memory usage and then terminate it.


#to display the filtered processes consuming memory more than 0 and display the highest process
ps aux | awk '$4>0 {print $0}' | sort -k4,4nr | head -n1

#to terminate the highest memory consuming process 
ps aux | awk '$4>0 {print $0}' | sort -k4,4nr | head -n1 | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
#5) Use the networking tool command and print all the gateway available in a sorted manner

#to see all networks in the system 
netstat -rn 

# to print all the gateways available in sorted manner
netstat -rn | grep '^0.0.0.0' | awk '{print $2}' | sort
